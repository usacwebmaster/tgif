		"desc": "The Student Leadership Institute for Climate Resilience (SLICR) is a UC-wide program that supports undergraduate and graduate students in their learning of leadership, social justice, and climate and community resilience. During its inaugural year at UCLA, Housing and Residential Life selected 20 students from a variety of majors, educational years, and social identities to participate in a three-day program in Big Bear, California. SLICR's curriculum covered identity awareness and development, personal and community resilience, the intersections of sustainability and social justice, how to create regenerative economies, and reflections on the process of leadership. This program was developed and facilitated by both full-time and student-staff, enabling UCLA students to develop skills around facilitation, community building, event planning, and curriculum design while also allowing for more representation of minoritized groups working in the field of sustainability."
